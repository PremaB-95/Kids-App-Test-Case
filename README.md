# Problem Statement

Suppose that you have been selected for this role and you are working for a client who needs a

Parental Control Mobile App. The client expects the apps to fulfill following scenarios â€“

- The parent app should be able to track the duration for which any app on the kid device is used.
- The parent app should be able to block any app from the kid device. Kids should NOT be able to use blocked apps.
- Parents should be able to set a usage time limit for any app from the kid device. After the time limit, the respective app should be blocked for that particular day. From next day onwards, usage time resets and the kid gets a time limit for the day.
- Suppose the parent categorizes apps into multiple categories - social, chat, business etc. And he sets time limits for each category. Apps belonging to the same category cannot cumulatively spend more time than the time limit set by Parent.
